# Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption for STEG

## Overview

The **Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG)**, a public and non-administrative entity responsible for energy distribution in Tunisia, faced significant losses amounting to 200 million Tunisian Dinars due to fraudulent meter manipulations by consumers. To address this challenge, I developed a solution aimed at detecting and mitigating fraudulent activities leveraging client billing history data.

## About STEG

- **Mission**: STEG's core mission is to ensure efficient and reliable electricity and gas services across Tunisia, catering to the needs of residential and commercial consumers.

## Solution Approach

Utilizing advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, I created a solution tailored to STEG's specific requirements:

1. **Data Preparation**: Processed and cleaned client billing history data spanning from 2005 to 2019, ensuring data quality and consistency.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**: Engineered relevant features from the billing data to capture patterns indicative of fraudulent activities, such as irregular consumption patterns or sudden spikes in usage.

3. **Model Development**: Developed a predictive model capable of detecting fraudulent behaviors based on historical billing data. Employed techniques such as anomaly detection, classification algorithms, and ensemble methods to achieve optimal performance.


## Solution Impact

The implementation of this solution is expected to yield several key benefits for STEG:

- **Fraud Prevention**: By accurately identifying instances of fraudulent meter manipulations, the solution helps prevent revenue losses and ensures fair billing practices.
  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated fraud detection processes enhance operational efficiency, allowing STEG to focus resources on delivering high-quality energy services.

- **Revenue Enhancement**: Reduced losses from fraudulent activities contribute to improved revenue streams, enabling STEG to invest in infrastructure development and service expansion initiatives.

## Conclusion

The Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption Solution represents a proactive approach to addressing the challenges faced by STEG in combating fraudulent activities. By leveraging data-driven insights and advanced analytics, the solution not only safeguards STEG's financial interests but also reinforces its commitment to delivering reliable energy services to the people of Tunisia.
